# General Purpose Processor Design
This is a general-purpose processor design that performs arithmetic and logical operations using an ALU. The design was implemented using Quartus II software and a Cyclone-II EP2C35F672C6 FPGA board.

## Objectives

The purpose of this lab is to design and construct an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) capable of performing various arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU comprises four main components:

1. Control Unit: Collects instructions to compute operations.
2. Bus: Controls access to data.
3. Registers: Temporarily store data.
5. ALU Core: Performs the operations.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies and tools were used to develop and test the ALU:

1. Hardware Description Language: VHDL
2. Development Environment: Quartus II
3. Hardware Platform: Cyclone-II EP2C35F672C6 FPGA Board
4. Simulation Tools: Quartus II Waveform Simulation
5. Display Interface: Seven-segment displays for real-time output
6. Version Control: Git
